# Ionic 2 Angular2 Webpack Starter

Based on [Angular2 Webpack Starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter)
I want to port its awesomeness to ionic 2.

This seed repo serves as an Ionic 2 starter for anyone looking to get up and running with Ionic 2 and TypeScript fast. Using a [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) for building our files and assisting with boilerplate. We're also using Protractor for our end-to-end story and Karma for our unit tests.
* Best practices in file and application organization for Angular 2.
* Ready to go build system using Webpack for working with TypeScript.
* Ionic 2 examples that are ready to go when experimenting with in Ionic 2.
* A great Ionic 2 seed repo for anyone who wants to start their project.
* Testing Ionic 2 code with Jasmine and Karma.
* Coverage with Istanbul and Karma
* End-to-end Ionic 2 code using Protractor.
* Type manager with Typings
* Hot Module Replacement with Webpack
* Multiple environments
* Redux (not included just yet)

### TODO's
  - set up this README to fully support the quickstart section
  - fully integrate webpack / fix the errors
  - port coding best practices
  - enable HMR
  - when finished with build / testing setup integrate some smart code quality checks
  - afterwards add redux
